MS12-020 - CVE-2012-0002

- Remote Desktop Protocol
- (Speculative) Double-Free leading to Use-After-Free
- Occurs within the handling of the maxChannelIds field of the MCS Connect Initial PDU with GCC Conference Create Request

- Driver fails to handle an error, then forces it to abort and free an object
- The driver attempts to free it again, and fetches a virtual pointer

- Metasploit Framework's proof-of-concept leads to a different crash (access violation in SListRemove)
  * This gets past StackBufferAllocEx and skips over the potential code execution
- Original proof-of-concept would be better suited
- Differentiating the two...
  * CVE-2012-0002 (Metasploit) sends numerous unknown requests (in Wireshark it appears to be random TCP traffic)
  * CVE-2012-0002 (Original) sends numerous channelJoinConfirm requests
- Both proof-of-concepts require multiple attempts to trigger
